BIG ITEMS:
    - SMOOTH ROTATIONS

-allow terrain.cpp to start without a camera :p
-Add a camera mode that follows its Object PTM if possible? (I.e, Origin is PTM instead of 0,0,0.)

Dreamboat:

-Camera should utilize an extra "trans" style object for the camera, in addition to the implicit inherited one for his model.

Cameras class:
Camera &Cameras::Active( size_t n ) {
  if (n < camList.size()) {
    activeCamera = n;
  }
  camList.at(activeCamera).Send( Camera::CTM );
  return Active();
}
Implement an "Active" or "Send All" function straight in Camera, avoid sending only the CTM.

-upside-down camera correction? (detect when we are upside down, invert looks?)
