They are credited in-line where appropriate, but here's a list:\r\n  \r\n  - Etay Mieri, olgdev.atspace.co.uk:\r\n    \t Invaluable tutorials on OpenGL.  \r\n\r\n  - Daniel Beard, Paul Boxley and Paul Martz:\r\n    \t   Information and code for generating random terrain.\r\n\t   The code we eventually implemented is heavily modified\r\n\t   from Daniel Beard's implementation, using Boxley and Martz's \r\n\t   writeups as guidelines.\r\n\r\n  - Ed Angel:\r\n      Author of \"Interactive Computer Graphics: A Top-Down Approach,\"\r\n      Provided the basis of our executable's main skeleton, \r\n      and 99.9% of our vec and mat classes, from his book's code.\r\n\r\n  - Gabriele Randelli:\r\n      Lead developer of the WiiC/PP library, which itself has been\r\n      developed out of the (now defunct) WiiUse library, authored by\r\n      Michael Laforest.\r\n\r\n  - Dan Lecocq:\r\n      For a really great blog post on how to draw a mesh with\r\n      GL_TRIANGLE_STRIPs.\r\n\r\n- To build the project, pushd Flythrough && make;\r\n  To run, pushd Flythrough && ./fly;\r\n\r\n- Controls (as of Mon 03 Dec 2012)\r\n  w,a,s,d: Forward, back, strafe left and right (As in most commercial FPS games)\r\n  mouse: Look around.\r\n  click and move mouse: Rotate left or right.\r\n  \r\n  1-7, 0: Control rotating light distance,\r\n  m: change light mode\r\n  n: change light position\r\n\r\n  z,x,c,v,b: Various perspective modes.\r\n\r\n  +,-: Add or remove cameras.\r\n\r\n- wiic/pp library utilizes the LGPL license,\r\n  The source code is included in our source tree here for convenience,\r\n  with minor alterations.","tagline":"An OpenGL project for UML Graphics I with Professor Grinstein","google":""}
