Hello!

What's here:

1) Eclipse CDT auto-formatting rules for this project. They should be pretty reasonable, but Eclipse has some weird auto-formatting bugs.

2) fMod .so files and a small script to assist users in installing them to a reasonable directory.

3) Matrix.rkt -- Racket definitions that emulate some basic matrix manipulations to assist in debugging transformational optimisations.

4) wiic_r90 -- The latest source release of WiiC/PP, along with a compile-and-install script to install the libraries.
