This repository is the workspace for the Spring 2013 Computer Graphics course at UMass Lowell.

Since it is shared space, please be sure to put an author, date, and description at the top of files you create or modify.

Feel free to add any graphics code to this repository, even small examples or demos.

So far I have added our [WebGL examples from last semester](https://github.com/UMLComputerGraphics/GraphicsProject/tree/gh-pages/WebGLExamples).
